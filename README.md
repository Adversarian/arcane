ARCANE is a novel framework whose aim is to provide adversarial robustness to classifier model using class-conditional generative models. By projecting a given potentially adversarial sample onto the distribution learned through a generative model, ARCANE is also able to purify a given sample as well detect whether or not it adversarial.
